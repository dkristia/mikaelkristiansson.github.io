## About Me

My name is Mikael and Im located in <span class="underline decoration-dotted">Sweden</span>.
I started my coding journey at University where I studied Java, Flash (AS2), SQL, UML and HTML.
This lead to my first work experience as a developer where I got to work with Flash and creating school material for interactive whiteboards.
Then <span class="t-yellow">Flash</span> died out and html5 was the new thing aligned with <span class="t-red">Angular</span> launched. I worked with Angular for 2 years, then I found <span class="t-blue">React</span> with <span class="t-pink">Redux</span> which was revolutionary.
Since then I've been deep into React and recently I've learned to love <span class="t-orange">Svelte</span> as well ♥️.
<br />
Technologies Im comfortable working with:

<ul class="two-col">
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Svelte</li>
    <li>Gatsby / NextJS</li>
    <li>Tauri</li>
    <li>TailwindCSS</li>
    <li>SASS</li>
</ul>
<br>

While Im not coding I enjoy working out (especially calisthenics outdoors), play guitar and having fun with my kids/fiance.
